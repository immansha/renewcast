SECTION 4 - MAINTENANCE PROTOCOLS

4.1 Routine Schedule:
  Panel cleaning: every 15 days (desert dust accumulation)
  Inverter inspection: monthly
  Thermal imaging: quarterly
  String performance test: semi-annually

4.2 Soiling Loss Assessment:
Typical soiling loss in Rajasthan: 3-8% without regular cleaning.
If inverter efficiency drops below 94.5% without weather explanation:
  Initiate soiling investigation before inverter replacement.

4.3 Inverter Fault Protocol:
If measured efficiency is below rated by more than 3%:
  Step 1: Check firmware update via manufacturer portal
  Step 2: Inspect cooling fans and heat sinks
  Step 3: Run inverter self-diagnostic mode
  Step 4: If unresolved in 4 hours escalate to manufacturer service

4.4 Emergency Shutdown:
If AC output drops to zero during daylight:
  Contact RLDC within 5 minutes: 0141-2744444
  Submit deviation intimation on POSOCO portal within 15 minutes
